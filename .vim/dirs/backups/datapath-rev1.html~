    <p>My first revision of the clock's main datapath was a BEAST. At this time, I was still pretty committed to building the system using low level components only, so this circuit board was monstrous.</p>

    <p>In the second revision, (coming soon) I plan on replacing the adder/and/register structure (pictured below for the millisecond system) with a simple decade counter (7493). In my rough sketches, this has reduced the number of ICs from 26 to ~16 or so.</p>
